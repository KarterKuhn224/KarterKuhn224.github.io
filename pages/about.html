  <h1>How I Turned My Passion into a Project</h1>
  
  <p>Many high schools and rec centers struggle to keep track of scorekeeping during fast-paced basketball games. They often rely on outdated, bulky equipment that’s hard to transport and limits flexibility.</p>

  <p>That’s why I created the Moveable Basketball Scoreboard—a portable, modern solution that brings real-time scoring to any court, anywhere. It’s easy to use, highly visible, and designed for the modern game.</p>
